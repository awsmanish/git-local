Step to recover lost ssh key :-
First create new instance in same availability zone and check 2/2 status check
Then stopped both instances and wait for fully stopped
Then detach volume from old instance and attach to new instance which we just created 
Then start instance and wait untill it shows fully 2/2status check 
Ssh into new instance 
And write this 
sudo -i

mkdir recover     (Note :- if you want to do best practice then create  into /mnt otherwise anywhere it work )
mount /dev/xvdf1 recover   ( note if you face wrong fs type then use first blkid to check which file system it get then use this     -->.     mount -t xfs -o nouuid /dev/xvdf1 recover )


cat /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys > recover/home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys


umount /dev/xvdf1

Then stopped instance wait till fully stopped then detach volume and give name /dev/xvda and attached to old instance 

Then take ssh using new key of old instance
