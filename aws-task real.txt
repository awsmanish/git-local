Real Time Task 
Auto Scaling based on CPU Utilization with EC2 Auto Scaling
* Set up EC2 Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of instances based on CPU utilization metrics.
* Configure CloudWatch Alarms to trigger scaling actions in real-time when CPU thresholds are exceeded.
* Monitor auto scaling events and instances in real-time to ensure optimal resource utilization and application performance
 Database Replication and Failover with RDS Multi-AZ
* Configure RDS Multi-AZ deployment for automatic synchronous replication of your database to a standby instance.
* Monitor Multi-AZ replication status and database health metrics in real-time.
* Trigger automatic failover to the standby instance in case of primary database failure.
Log Analysis with CloudWatch Logs Insights
* Utilize CloudWatch Logs Insights to analyze log data from various AWS services in real-time.
* Create custom log queries to identify trends, errors, or patterns in logs for troubleshooting or security analysis.
* Monitor log analysis results in real-time and set up automated actions or alerts based on specific log query results.
Network Load Balancing with Application Load Balancer and Target Tracking Scaling
* Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances in real-time.
* Set up target tracking scaling with ALB to automatically adjust the number of instances based on the target's average request count or CPU utilization.
* Monitor ALB metrics and target tracking scaling activities in real-time for efficient traffic management and optimal application performance.
Network Traffic Monitoring with VPC Flow Logs and CloudWatch Logs
* Enable VPC Flow Logs to capture and log network traffic metadata at the subnet or ENI level.
* Stream VPC Flow Logs to CloudWatch Logs for real-time analysis, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
* Set up real-time log alerts or use CloudWatch Logs Insights to identify network traffic anomalies or security threats.
Volume Monitoring with CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms
* Enable CloudWatch Metrics for EBS volumes to collect real-time performance metrics such as throughput and latency.
* Set up CloudWatch Alarms to trigger notifications or actions when volume performance metrics exceed predefined thresholds.
* Monitor volume metrics and alarms in real-time to identify and address performance bottlenecks or capacity issues.

 Instance Monitoring and Performance Analysis with EC2 Systems Manager
* Utilize EC2 Systems Manager to collect real-time metrics and logs from instances.
* Set up CloudWatch Dashboards to monitor CPU, memory, disk utilization, and network traffic in real-time.
* Configure CloudWatch Alarms to trigger notifications when performance thresholds are breached.
Access Control with IAM Roles and Instance Metadata
* Create IAM roles with time-limited permissions for EC2 instances.
* Use instance metadata to retrieve temporary credentials for real-time access to AWS services.
* Monitor and rotate IAM role credentials regularly to ensure security and minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
Create a mechanism which should send me notification over email if there is  change in IAM policy, role.
Create a mechanism which should send me notification over email if there is any change in s3 service like creating bucket, any change in bucket policy etc.
